# inkitt-frontend

A simple project (with no api) to simulate comment system in Reddit.
it has:

- custom Webpack Config
- Typescript
- CSS modules beside normal css files and Tailwind for base CSS
- docker
- eslint/prettier/husky
- Redux/Redux-Saga
- Sentry for error tracking (not complete config, just initilized)

## tl;dr

- clone project and go to folder
- Install by executing `npm install` or `yarn`.
- to start server just use this command `npm start`. it will be run on port 4000.
- to start server with docker you can use docker file that is provided.


# final words

Thanks in advance and looking for your comment.
